Sociologists have found that the density of nonprofits influences urban outcomes, but there is a lack of clarity on how and why this happens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We theorize a critical distinction between the organizational production of social integration (connecting people to one another) and systemic integration (connecting people to complex systems, such as the economy or politics). We then examine the organizational practices that enable the production of each.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our first paper, we identify two modal forms of expertise (street-level and suite-level expertise, embodied by staff and volunteers) that shape organizational capacity to produce social and systemic integration, respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our second &lt;a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ve85b/" target=_blank>paper&lt;/a>, we theorize the internal processes that enable organizations pursue both forms of integration simultaneously: loose demographic coupling and communal anchoring. This paper advances work at the intersection of organizations and inequality by revealing how inequalities are justified in nonprofits, as women and minorities are relegated to the underpaid but morally valorized work of “community building.”&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bridge: The pursuit of commitment across lines of difference</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/book/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/book/</guid><description>&lt;p>My book dissertation explores the process of cultivating &lt;em>civic commitments across lines&lt;/em> of difference within an institution that shapes American society: prestigious research universities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through two ethnographic cases – a progressive nonprofit for marginalized students and a Pentecostal campus ministry – I trace the experiences of students who see themselves as strangers on campus and navigate strangerhood through their participation in communal, identity-based groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drawing on four years of fieldwork and 100 interviews with students, recent graduates, and organizational staff, I explore how students’ beliefs and moral commitments evolve, how they sustain rare identities through participation in communal groups, and the practical challenges they face trying to build inclusive organizations.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
