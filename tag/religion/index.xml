&lt;p>Through two ethnographic cases – a progressive nonprofit for marginalized students and a Pentecostal campus ministry – I trace the experiences of students who see themselves as strangers on campus and navigate strangerhood through their participation in communal, identity-based groups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Drawing on four years of fieldwork and 100 interviews with students, recent graduates, and organizational staff, I explore how students’ beliefs and moral commitments evolve, how they sustain rare identities through participation in communal groups, and the practical challenges they face trying to build inclusive organizations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How culture shapes action</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/culture/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/culture/</guid><description>&lt;p>I examine how culture and meaning-making shape individual, social, and organizational outcomes in multiple independent and collaborative projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my paper, “Semiotic Shifts,” I advance existing debates in cultural sociology by theorizing how strategies of action evolve in the face of semiotic shifts, which occur when people enter institutional contexts and encounter new meanings for their beliefs. I theorize three modal strategies that people adopt in the face of semiotic shifts – distancing, bridging, and burrowing. I find that these strategies are linked to the cultural forms that students’ beliefs embodied prior to college (as common sense, tradition, and ideology). This paper is under review (&lt;a href="https://krystallaryea.github.io/uploads/laryea_semiotic_2022.pdf" target="_blank">PDF available here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a collaborative &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00031224221076487&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1662414820016825&amp;usg=AOvVaw3eURDRSSCJplssFK6cST97" target=_blank>paper&lt;/a> recently published in &lt;em>American Sociological Review&lt;/em>, we use mixed methods to show how religious habitus shapes educational outcomes, especially for women. We argue that Jewish women grow up in religious cultural contexts that shape their self-concepts (and the centrality of higher education and career), which helps explain religious differences in vertical and horizontal stratification in educational attainment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With &lt;a href="https://positiveorgs.bus.umich.edu/people/elizabeth-trinh/" target=_blank>Elizabeth Trinh&lt;/a>, we are studying how nonprofit leaders strive to cultivate meaningful work environments and draw on personal sources of meaning to do so. Our first paper received a revise and resubmit from &lt;em>Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/em>. A draft is available upon request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, in an &lt;a href="https://krystallaryea.github.io/uploads/laryea_ambiguous_2021.pdf" target="_blank">article&lt;/a> published in the &lt;em>Journal of Higher Education&lt;/em>, my colleagues and I theorize how people interpret and utilize ambiguous credentials, using the case of massively open online courses (a low-status credential offered by high-status universities). We reveal the risks and opportunities faced by learners seeking to leverage ambiguous credentials in the labor market.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
