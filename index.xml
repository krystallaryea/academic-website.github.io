&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Krystal&amp;rsquo;s detailed feedback, general encouragement, and insightful comments in class were very &lt;mark>helpful in my learning development&lt;/mark> throughout the quarter.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;[Krystal is] very &lt;mark>engaging and considerate&lt;/mark> at the same time. I deeply appreciated her willingness to listen and help.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Krystal was thoughtful in marking memos and giving feedback; she would not only give line-by-line feedback, but would also give summarizing commentary that explained both high- and low-level feedback, which was incredibly helpful for the development of my ideas. She was very fair and clearly thought deeply about our memos; in class, &lt;mark>she would often make comments that tied together contributions from different students&amp;rsquo; memos, which speaks to the volume of effort&lt;/mark> that Krystal put into this class. Finally, Krystal is a deeply caring person, and repeatedly brought up (in 1-1 communications) aspects about my personal and intellectual development. I felt like Krystal was able to see me as more than a face on Zoom call but as a human being.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Krystal cares deeply about providing thorough and detailed feedback to students. She was &lt;mark>responsive, not afraid to challenge our thinking, and pushed me&lt;/mark> to go deeper into understanding the course content.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I really appreciated all the time that Krystal took into grading our memos. Each week &lt;mark>she would get them back to us the next day&lt;/mark> with tons of helpful feedback and comments.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

We are encountering diverse contexts that pose challenges to us as individuals, as well as any hope of forging deep community and cultivating shared institutions. Existing work highlights some of the mechanisms that drive and challenge exclusion and polarization – from homophily, social influence, and stereotyping to intergroup contact and social differentiation. But these theories do not account for the moral frameworks that guide action. I argue that we need to bring tools from cultural sociology to bear on the question of how to build community across lines of difference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To develop this approach, I focus on the case of how students with multiple minority identities navigate modern universities. I conducted a comparative ethnographic study of two groups: a diverse community of evangelical Christians at a secular, private university and a progressive nonprofit that serves underrepresented minorities at a prestigious, public university. Drawing on four years of fieldwork and 100 interviews, I identified and theorized three modal strategies of action that people deployed to navigate personal beliefs and identities pluralistic spaces: &lt;em>burrowing&lt;/em> (embedding in one group and foregoing others), &lt;em>distancing&lt;/em> (foregoing former groups, identities and/or beliefs), and &lt;em>bridging&lt;/em> (belonging to multiple, oppositional groups which requires reckoning with new beliefs while maintaining long-held belief anchors). An &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AM_WW0rpOgwJ_ooxQHVBWRAM2_knQf3b" target="_blank">article&lt;/a> based on this analysis is under review.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the second half of my dissertation, I shift from focusing on how individuals navigate diverse contexts to focusing on how identity-based groups navigate internal diversity among their members. I consider how both groups that I studied acted as burrowing spaces for their core members (Chapter 4) but were transformed into bridging spaces through an interactional process that I call &lt;em>playing up difference&lt;/em>, where members bring non-shared identities and beliefs to the fore of group life (Chapter 5). An &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SsW_KIC4CrsHTQPY_1kOElIXVqgROJtg/" target="_blank">independent article&lt;/a> based on Chapter 5 received an R&amp;amp;R from &lt;em>Sociological Theory&lt;/em> and won the ASA Theory section’s Best Graduate Student Paper Award.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In former projects, my work has examined how universities themselves act as agents of inclusion and exclusion in society. In a &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00031224221076487" target="_blank">paper&lt;/a> published in &lt;em>American Sociological Review&lt;/em>, my (then-student) colleagues and I examine the mechanisms underlying the stratification of higher education by gender and religious subculture. We find that girls raised by Jewish parents develop self-concepts that facilitate their efforts to attend highly selective universities, underscoring the habitus that such organizations require. Additionally, in a first-author &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00221546.2020.1851571" target="_blank">paper&lt;/a> in the &lt;em>Journal of Higher Education&lt;/em>, we show how massively online open courses operate as ambiguous credentials, opening access to elite courses, but also risks as people strive to leverage such credentials in the labor market.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The mesofoundations of integration in modern cities</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/commitments/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/commitments/</guid><description>&lt;p>My second line of research asks: &lt;em>when and how do organizations contribute to the production of meaning, community, and integration?&lt;/em> Sociologists have shown that the presence of organizations causally affects such outcomes as connectedness, social capital, crime, entrepreneurship, and crisis resilience. But extant studies leave unclear the &lt;em>processes&lt;/em> – both internal (among members) and external (in their environments) through which organizations produce personal, social, and systemic integration. I identify these processes through my work with the &lt;a href="https://pacscenter.stanford.edu/research/civic-life-of-cities-lab/" target="_blank">Civic Life of Cities Lab&lt;/a>, where we have collected data on over 600 nonprofits across six global cities. As part of this broader study, I led the collection of over 50 in-depth interviews with the leaders of Bay Area nonprofits.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the production of meaning, I am spearheading a project on how organizational leaders strive to foster meaningful work environments for their staff. Drawing on in-depth longitudinal interviews that we conducted with 43 organizational leaders (before, during, and after the pandemic), we reveal the surprising fragility and fundamental relationality of meaningful work. This paper has received an R&amp;amp;R at &lt;em>Administrative Science Quarterly&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the production of integration, I am co-leading a series of papers that examine how organizational structures and practices shape the production of two types of integration: social integration, creating social ties among constituents, and systemic integration, connecting constituents to institutional resources. In our first &lt;a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ve85b/" target="_blank">paper&lt;/a>, we argue that organizations’ pursuit of social and systemic integration is linked to whether they prioritize suite-level (professional) expertise or street-level (experiential) expertise among their staff and volunteers. In a second, forthcoming paper, we examine what allows some organizations to pursue both forms of integration simultaneously.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, on the production of community, I have studied how community can be maintained in the face of change. In an &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11133-023-09532-y" target="_blank">paper&lt;/a> published in &lt;em>Qualitative Sociology&lt;/em>, I use the case of how “Christian Fellowship” navigated the coronavirus pandemic to advance theorizing on how frames shape communal participation. I argue that reframing is triggered by temporal disconnect between past frames and present circumstances, present circumstances and imagined futures, or all three. My findings offer insights on how organizations striving to rebuild community post-pandemic might renew prior frames and fashion new ones.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>San Francisco Bay Area: A Left Coast Metropolis Grapples with Technocracy and Inequality</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publication/laryea_bay-area_2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publication/laryea_bay-area_2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> Researchers have investigated the demography and styles of engagement of those who enroll in MOOCs but have lent little attention to how learners navigate MOOCs’ ambiguity as academic certifications.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Analyzing semi-structured interviews with 60 people who devoted substantial time to at least one MOOC between 2014–2017, we find that people use MOOCs to build skills for application at work and home, build relationships, navigate life transitions, and enhance formal presentations of self, at the same time that they disagree on the meaning of MOOC completions as official academic accomplishments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our findings build theory on the multi-dimensional character of credential prestige that can inform educational social scientists and credential providers in an increasingly complicated postsecondary ecosystem.&lt;/p>

I draw on the case of a collegiate religious fellowship that moved online during the COVID-19 pandemic to examine how individuals’ participation patterns evolve their community undergoes a collective shift.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Members’ participation trajectories were puzzling: core members moved on while periphery members moved in, often becoming core members. I explain this puzzle through the process of reframing, wherein individuals craft working lenses that answer the question “what does this community mean to me now?” This temporal focus reveals that those with the most positive frames (of the community as “beautiful”) before the shift struggled most to adapt, reframing the group as “not what it once was.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By contrast, periphery members with ambivalent frames prior to the shift came to reframe the group as beautiful, leading them to deepen their engagement. These findings have relevance for member participation in a variety of communal contexts as well as theorizing on framing more broadly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Diversity as a Civil Religion</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/home-unused/laryea_diversity_2022/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/home-unused/laryea_diversity_2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Street Smarts and Org Charts: Professional Expertise and The Production of Urban Integration (under review)</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publication/brandtner_street_2022/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publication/brandtner_street_2022/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Predicting the Onset, Evolution and Postgraduate Impact of College Activism</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publication/mcadam_predicting_2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publication/mcadam_predicting_2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> The topics of differential recruitment to activism and its longer-term impacts have generated substantial empirical research. Yet, the lack of longitudinal studies of movement participation have limited our understanding of individual activism’s dynamics over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, we use six years of longitudinal survey data and two waves of interview data from a class of college students before, throughout, and after college to examine predictors of variation in college activism, the ebb and flow of activism over the course of college, and the effect of college activism on activism two years post-graduation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our findings dispute one consistent empirical claim in social movement studies and confirm another. Counter to the scholarly finding on the weak impact of predisposition on recruitment, we find that predisposition powerfully predicts variation in college activism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consistent with the claim that significant early activism is linked with future activism, we find that students’ activism at the end of college significantly predicts their engagement in activism after graduation.&lt;/p>

Local nonprofits face the tension of maintaining access to elite resources while building connections to distribute those resources and navigate divides between the haves and have-nots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We draw on original data collected over the course of two decades on a representative sample of Bay Area nonprofit organizations. With rich information from both quantitative and qualitative data, we examine different aspects of nonprofits’ relationship to their constituents and environments, including their community embeddedness, cross-sector collaborations, and engagement in advocacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We then turn to the internal operations of these organizations and survey the professional backgrounds of nonprofit leaders and the usage of practices that purportedly make nonprofits more professional, accountable, and digitally savvy. Our findings reveal a sector that is developing its own model of what community-directed management looks like, neither tethered strictly to a Left Coast ethos nor displaying uniform responses to strong institutional pressures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although the Bay Area sector pursues heterogeneous approaches to repairing social ruptures, there is a consistent theme of rebuilding and re-creating community. We argue that the region’s diversity in values, practices, and orientations stems from fighting deep fractures that resist simple solutions in a place marked by paradox.&lt;/p>

I advance scholarship on this question by theorizing how strategies of action evolve in the face of semiotic shifts, which occur when people enter institutional contexts and encounter new meanings for their preexisting beliefs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I draw on two years of ethnographic fieldwork and 49 interviews with conservative Protestant students attending an elite, secular university to empirically demonstrate how variation in forms of religious culture links to divergent strategies of action.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When religion takes the form of common sense, the dominant institutional culture brings about a semiotic shift and students’ distance from and reckon with their faith.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When religion takes the form of tradition, religious subculture brings about a semiotic shift and students bridge secular and religious meanings and spaces. Finally, when religion takes the form of ideology, students reject new semiotic axes and burrow into religious subcultures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bringing cultural and institutional theorizing into dialogue, this paper deepens our understanding of how culture matters as individuals learn to navigate new organizational contexts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Bat Mitzvah to the Bar: Religious Habitus, Self-Concept, and Women’s Educational Outcomes</title><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publication/horwitz_bat_2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/publication/horwitz_bat_2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract:&lt;/strong> This study considers the role of religious habitus and self-concept in educational stratification. We follow 3,238 adolescents for 13 years by linking the National Study of Youth and Religion to the National Student Clearinghouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Survey data reveal that girls with a Jewish upbringing have two distinct postsecondary patterns compared to girls with a non-Jewish upbringing, even after controlling for social origins: (1) they are 23 percentage points more likely to graduate college, and (2) they graduate from much more selective colleges. We then analyze 107 interviews with 33 girls from comparable social origins interviewed repeatedly between adolescence and emerging adulthood. Girls raised by Jewish parents articulate a self-concept marked by ambitious career goals and an eagerness to have new experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For these girls, elite higher education and graduate school are central to attaining self-concept congruence. In contrast, girls raised by non-Jewish parents tend to prioritize motherhood and have humbler employment aims. For them, graduating from college, regardless of its prestige, is sufficient for self-concept congruence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We conclude that religious subculture is a key factor in educational stratification, and divergent paths to self-concept congruence can help explain why educational outcomes vary by religion in gendered ways.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Analyzing semi-structured interviews with 60 people who devoted substantial time to at least one MOOC between 2014–2017, we find that people use MOOCs to build skills for application at work and home, build relationships, navigate life transitions, and enhance formal presentations of self, at the same time that they disagree on the meaning of MOOC completions as official academic accomplishments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our findings build theory on the multi-dimensional character of credential prestige that can inform educational social scientists and credential providers in an increasingly complicated postsecondary ecosystem.&lt;/p>

In this repeated measures, mixed-methods study, we examined the relationship of purpose to coping with adversity among young adolescents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A sample of 1357 adolescents completed a survey about purpose, negative life events, and positive reframing coping four times at six month intervals. A sub-sample of 91 survey respondents participated in an interview. Surveys were analyzed using fixed-effects and mixed-effects modeling to test the relationship between purpose and coping over time. Interviews were analyzed for purpose, adversity, and coping to understand this relationship as perceived by the participant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Survey results indicate that purpose and positive reframing coping are related and change together over time. Interview results suggest that purpose can be a response to negative experiences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are likely underlying factors or processes driving the relationship between purpose and positive reframing coping. Some of the potential underlying factors and processes are discussed.&lt;/p>

He has an unusual ability to see nuance where others are reductionistic, to reveal paradoxes that the reader immediately recognizes as spot on. Few have difficulty seeing the messiness of the American higher education system, but Labaree is the first to call this a perfect mess. Not that he believes the system is perfect, but he does argue that the messiness is intrinsic to the nature of the system. Not only that, what appears as &amp;lsquo;messy&amp;rsquo; is in large part responsible for the greatness of the American higher education system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The arch of the book is evident in the subtitle: Labaree traces the unlikely ascendancy of American higher education, showing first and foremost that the system arose without a plan. He traces the historical evolution of a ragtag group of antebellum colleges that became a very robust higher education system by the early twentieth century. The book serves as a (brief) institutional history, a historical sociology of the evolving form of the American higher education system. It is, in a sense, a case study of one very large, very complex educational system: one that is unlike any other higher education system in the world. Because the system itself is the object of analysis, Labaree&amp;rsquo;s book does not closely mirror other historical books on American higher education, which tend to focus more on individual institutions (Veysey 1965; Thelin 2013). While Labaree draws on stories and examples of individual institutions to demonstrate parts of his argument, this is in service to his primary goal: tracing the emergence of the system itself and what makes it work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chapter 1 lays out some of the theoretical groundwork for his analysis, and between chapters 1-3 the author flies through a brief history of American colleges in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Labaree acknowledges that calling the eighteenth century colleges a system at all is a stretch but argues that what looked like chaos was, in fact, the infancy of the system we know now. The nineteenth century (chapter 3) marks the adolescence of the system: it was physically evolving much faster than it was intellectually maturing. Supply preceded demand, and while these scrappy institutions were barely recognizable to European visitors as colleges, Labaree identifies in them a set of characteristics which would prove invaluable as history played out: broad-based political support, large and multiple forms of revenue, institutional autonomy, and organizational capacity. His main point is that these traits emerged out of necessity, not intentionality. American colleges have always been market-based institutions; in some ways they looked and acted more like modern start-ups than their European counterparts such as Oxford or the Sorbonne.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://krystallaryea.github.io/admin/config.yml</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://krystallaryea.github.io/admin/config.yml</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
