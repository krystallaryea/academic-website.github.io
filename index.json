My research agenda tackles fundamental questions in cultural sociology, organizational sociology, and the study of civil society. My primary line of research explores the microfoundations of inclusion by examining how people with minority identities and beliefs navigate pluralistic universities. A second, complementary line of research probes the meso foundations of integration through examining how nonprofits and their leaders strive to make meaning, build community, and connect people to institutional resources. My next major project will examine the microfoundations of equity through studying how people and organizations engage in voluntary downward mobility as a form of civic sacrifice.\nAcross these projects, I draw on diverse methods, including in-depth interviews, organizational ethnography, and longitudinal surveys, to uncover local mechanisms through which cohesion, trust, and common goods can be advanced in diverse organizations and societies.\nMy research has been published in American Sociological Review, Qualitative Sociology, Mobilization, the Journal of Higher Education, Voluntas, and Global Perspectives.

We follow 3,238 adolescents for 13 years by linking the National Study of Youth and Religion to the National Student Clearinghouse.\nSurvey data reveal that girls with a Jewish upbringing have two distinct postsecondary patterns compared to girls with a non-Jewish upbringing, even after controlling for social origins: (1) they are 23 percentage points more likely to graduate college, and (2) they graduate from much more selective colleges. We then analyze 107 interviews with 33 girls from comparable social origins interviewed repeatedly between adolescence and emerging adulthood. Girls raised by Jewish parents articulate a self-concept marked by ambitious career goals and an eagerness to have new experiences.\nFor these girls, elite higher education and graduate school are central to attaining self-concept congruence. In contrast, girls raised by non-Jewish parents tend to prioritize motherhood and have humbler employment aims. For them, graduating from college, regardless of its prestige, is sufficient for self-concept congruence.\nWe conclude that religious subculture is a key factor in educational stratification, and divergent paths to self-concept congruence can help explain why educational outcomes vary by religion in gendered ways.\nReceived media coverage from: The Washington Post, Tulane News, Cornell Chronicle, NewsWise, Phys.org, Futurity, The Jewish Press, The Jerusalem Post, Reddit (Front Page), Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Religion News Service, and Rocket News.

In this repeated measures, mixed-methods study, we examined the relationship of purpose to coping with adversity among young adolescents.\nA sample of 1357 adolescents completed a survey about purpose, negative life events, and positive reframing coping four times at six month intervals. A sub-sample of 91 survey respondents participated in an interview. Surveys were analyzed using fixed-effects and mixed-effects modeling to test the relationship between purpose and coping over time.

He has an unusual ability to see nuance where others are reductionistic, to reveal paradoxes that the reader immediately recognizes as spot on. Few have difficulty seeing the messiness of the American higher education system, but Labaree is the first to call this a perfect mess. Not that he believes the system is perfect, but he does argue that the messiness is intrinsic to the nature of the system. Not only that, what appears as ‚Äòmessy‚Äô is in large part responsible for the greatness of the American higher education system.\nThe arch of the book is evident in the subtitle: Labaree traces the unlikely ascendancy of American higher education, showing first and foremost that the system arose without a plan. He traces the historical evolution of a ragtag group of antebellum colleges that became a very robust higher education system by the early twentieth century. The book serves as a (brief) institutional history, a historical sociology of the evolving form of the American higher education system. It is, in a sense, a case study of one very large, very complex educational system: one that is unlike any other higher education system in the world. Because the system itself is the object of analysis, Labaree‚Äôs book does not closely mirror other historical books on American higher education, which tend to focus more on individual institutions (Veysey 1965; Thelin 2013). While Labaree draws on stories and examples of individual institutions to demonstrate parts of his argument, this is in service to his primary goal: tracing the emergence of the system itself and what makes it work.\nChapter 1 lays out some of the theoretical groundwork for his analysis, and between chapters 1-3 the author flies through a brief history of American colleges in the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Labaree acknowledges that calling the eighteenth century colleges a system at all is a stretch but argues that what looked like chaos was, in fact, the infancy of the system we know now. The nineteenth century (chapter 3) marks the adolescence of the system: it was physically evolving much faster than it was intellectually maturing. Supply preceded demand, and while these scrappy institutions were barely recognizable to European visitors as colleges, Labaree identifies in them a set of characteristics which would prove invaluable as history played out: broad-based political support, large and multiple forms of revenue, institutional autonomy, and organizational capacity. His main point is that these traits emerged out of necessity, not intentionality. American colleges have always been market-based institutions; in some ways they looked and acted more like modern start-ups than their European counterparts such as Oxford or the Sorbonne.\n","date":1540339200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540339200,"objectID":"1fd4824928f8a373f56e08c860391b34","permalink":"https://krystallaryea.github.io/publication/smith_perfect_2019/","publishdate":"2018-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/smith_perfect_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"From Someone Has to Fail to A Perfect Mess, David Labaree has long established his reputation for developing compelling, contrarian arguments on American educational institutions.

Sociologists have shown that the presence of organizations causally affects such outcomes as connectedness, social capital, crime, entrepreneurship, and crisis resilience. But extant studies leave unclear the processes ‚Äì both internal (among members) and external (in their environments) through which organizations produce personal, social, and systemic integration. I identify these processes through my work with the Civic Life of Cities Lab, where we have collected data on over 600 nonprofits across six global cities. As part of this broader study, I led the collection of over 50 in-depth interviews with the leaders of Bay Area nonprofits.\nOn the production of meaning, I am spearheading a project on how organizational leaders strive to foster meaningful work environments for their staff. Drawing on in-depth longitudinal interviews that we conducted with 43 organizational leaders (before, during, and after the pandemic), we reveal the surprising fragility and fundamental relationality of meaningful work. This paper has received an R\u0026amp;R at Administrative Science Quarterly.\nOn the production of integration, I am co-leading a series of papers that examine how organizational structures and practices shape the production of two types of integration: social integration, creating social ties among constituents, and systemic integration, connecting constituents to institutional resources. In our first paper, we argue that organizations‚Äô pursuit of social and systemic integration is linked to whether they prioritize suite-level (professional) expertise or street-level (experiential) expertise among their staff and volunteers. In a second, forthcoming paper, we examine what allows some organizations to pursue both forms of integration simultaneously.\nFinally, on the production of community, I have studied how community can be maintained in the face of change. In an paper published in Qualitative Sociology, I use the case of how ‚ÄúChristian Fellowship‚Äù navigated the coronavirus pandemic to advance theorizing on how frames shape communal participation. I argue that reframing is triggered by temporal disconnect between past frames and present circumstances, present circumstances and imagined futures, or all three. My findings offer insights on how organizations striving to rebuild community post-pandemic might renew prior frames and fashion new ones.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5cb259f51486e529c24a388c6151d6ef","permalink":"https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/commitments/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/commitments/","section":"projects","summary":"My second line of research asks: when and how do organizations contribute to the production of meaning, community, and integration?

The demographic and ideological pluralism that marks modern societies is unprecedented. We are encountering diverse contexts that pose challenges to us as individuals, as well as any hope of forging deep community and cultivating shared institutions. Existing work highlights some of the mechanisms that drive and challenge exclusion and polarization ‚Äì from homophily, social influence, and stereotyping to intergroup contact and social differentiation. But these theories do not account for the moral frameworks that guide action. I argue that we need to bring tools from cultural sociology to bear on the question of how to build community across lines of difference.\nTo develop this approach, I focus on the case of how students with multiple minority identities navigate modern universities. I conducted a comparative ethnographic study of two groups: a diverse community of evangelical Christians at a secular, private university and a progressive nonprofit that serves underrepresented minorities at a prestigious, public university. Drawing on four years of fieldwork and 100 interviews, I identified and theorized three modal strategies of action that people deployed to navigate personal beliefs and identities pluralistic spaces: burrowing (embedding in one group and foregoing others), distancing (foregoing former groups, identities and/or beliefs), and bridging (belonging to multiple, oppositional groups which requires reckoning with new beliefs while maintaining long-held belief anchors). An article based on this analysis is under review.\nIn the second half of my dissertation, I shift from focusing on how individuals navigate diverse contexts to focusing on how identity-based groups navigate internal diversity among their members. I consider how both groups that I studied acted as burrowing spaces for their core members (Chapter 4) but were transformed into bridging spaces through an interactional process that I call playing up difference, where members bring non-shared identities and beliefs to the fore of group life (Chapter 5). An independent article based on Chapter 5 received an R\u0026amp;R from Sociological Theory and won the ASA Theory section‚Äôs Best Graduate Student Paper Award.\nIn former projects, my work has examined how universities themselves act as agents of inclusion and exclusion in society. In a paper published in American Sociological Review, my (then-student) colleagues and I examine the mechanisms underlying the stratification of higher education by gender and religious subculture. We find that girls raised by Jewish parents develop self-concepts that facilitate their efforts to attend highly selective universities, underscoring the habitus that such organizations require. Additionally, in a first-author paper in the Journal of Higher Education, we show how massively online open courses operate as ambiguous credentials, opening access to elite courses, but also risks as people strive to leverage such credentials in the labor market.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"39c23c8a640f94d8770a8241dee7c31f","permalink":"https://krystallaryea.github.io/projects/book/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/projects/book/","section":"projects","summary":"My dissertation asks: how do people navigate institutional life together amid deep differences?
