We follow 3,238 adolescents for 13 years by linking the National Study of Youth and Religion to the National Student Clearinghouse.\nSurvey data reveal that girls with a Jewish upbringing have two distinct postsecondary patterns compared to girls with a non-Jewish upbringing, even after controlling for social origins: (1) they are 23 percentage points more likely to graduate college, and (2) they graduate from much more selective colleges. We then analyze 107 interviews with 33 girls from comparable social origins interviewed repeatedly between adolescence and emerging adulthood. Girls raised by Jewish parents articulate a self-concept marked by ambitious career goals and an eagerness to have new experiences.\nFor these girls, elite higher education and graduate school are central to attaining self-concept congruence. In contrast, girls raised by non-Jewish parents tend to prioritize motherhood and have humbler employment aims. For them, graduating from college, regardless of its prestige, is sufficient for self-concept congruence.\nWe conclude that religious subculture is a key factor in educational stratification, and divergent paths to self-concept congruence can help explain why educational outcomes vary by religion in gendered ways.\nReceived media coverage from: The Washington Post, Tulane News, Cornell Chronicle, NewsWise, Phys.org, Futurity, The Jewish Press, The Jerusalem Post, Reddit (Front Page), Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Religion News Service, and Rocket News.

Sociologists have found that the density of nonprofits influences urban outcomes, but there is a lack of clarity on how and why this happens.\nWe theorize a critical distinction between the organizational production of social integration (connecting people to one another) and systemic integration (connecting people to complex systems, such as the economy or politics). We then examine the organizational practices that enable the production of each.\nIn our first paper, which is under review, we identify two modal forms of expertise (street-level and suite-level expertise, embodied by staff and volunteers) that shape organizational capacity to produce social and systemic integration, respectively.\nIn our second paper, an invited submission to the RSO volume, Sociological Thinking in Contemporary Organizational Sholarship, we theorize the internal processes that enable organizations pursue both forms of integration simultaneously: loose demographic coupling and communal anchoring.

I theorize three modal strategies that people adopt in the face of semiotic shifts ‚Äì distancing, bridging, and burrowing. I find that these strategies are linked to the cultural forms that students‚Äô beliefs embodied prior to college (as common sense, tradition, and ideology). This paper is under review (PDF available here).\nIn a collaborative paper recently published in American Sociological Review, we use mixed methods to show how religious habitus shapes educational outcomes, especially for women. We argue that Jewish women grow up in religious cultural contexts that shape their self-concepts (and the centrality of higher education and career), which helps explain religious differences in vertical and horizontal stratification in educational attainment.\nWith Elizabeth Trinh, we are studying how nonprofit leaders strive to cultivate meaningful work environments and draw on personal sources of meaning to do so. Our first paper received a revise and resubmit from Administrative Science Quarterly. A draft is available upon request.\nFinally, in an article published in the Journal of Higher Education, my colleagues and I theorize how people interpret and utilize ambiguous credentials, using the case of massively open online courses (a low-status credential offered by high-status universities).
