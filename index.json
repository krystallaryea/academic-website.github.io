We follow 3,238 adolescents for 13 years by linking the National Study of Youth and Religion to the National Student Clearinghouse.\nSurvey data reveal that girls with a Jewish upbringing have two distinct postsecondary patterns compared to girls with a non-Jewish upbringing, even after controlling for social origins: (1) they are 23 percentage points more likely to graduate college, and (2) they graduate from much more selective colleges. We then analyze 107 interviews with 33 girls from comparable social origins interviewed repeatedly between adolescence and emerging adulthood. Girls raised by Jewish parents articulate a self-concept marked by ambitious career goals and an eagerness to have new experiences.\nFor these girls, elite higher education and graduate school are central to attaining self-concept congruence. In contrast, girls raised by non-Jewish parents tend to prioritize motherhood and have humbler employment aims. For them, graduating from college, regardless of its prestige, is sufficient for self-concept congruence.\nWe conclude that religious subculture is a key factor in educational stratification, and divergent paths to self-concept congruence can help explain why educational outcomes vary by religion in gendered ways.\nReceived media coverage from: The Washington Post, Tulane News, Cornell Chronicle, NewsWise, Phys.org, Futurity, The Jewish Press, The Jerusalem Post, Reddit (Front Page), Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Religion News Service, and Rocket News.

In this repeated measures, mixed-methods study, we examined the relationship of purpose to coping with adversity among young adolescents.\nA sample of 1357 adolescents completed a survey about purpose, negative life events, and positive reframing coping four times at six month intervals. A sub-sample of 91 survey respondents participated in an interview. Surveys were analyzed using fixed-effects and mixed-effects modeling to test the relationship between purpose and coping over time. Interviews were analyzed for purpose, adversity, and coping to understand this relationship as perceived by the participant.\nSurvey results indicate that purpose and positive reframing coping are related and change together over time. Interview results suggest that purpose can be a response to negative experiences.\nThere are likely underlying factors or processes driving the relationship between purpose and positive reframing coping.
